# Smart_Waste_Sorting_System_Code
 
This code is being used for a univesity project at queensland university of technology. The project requires the creation of a solution to any mechatronics problem the group has picked recycling.

This code will be used to run this system - it will take sensor inputs and move corospoding mechnical elements to sort recycling.

This is currently a vert basic implementation of this idea.
